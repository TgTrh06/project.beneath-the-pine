# 🌲 Beneath the Pine

Beneath the Pine is a reflection-first habit tracking app designed to help users build a compassionate relationship with themselves over time.

Instead of streaks and penalties, the app visualizes growth through tree rings — allowing effort, rest, and failure to coexist naturally.

## Features
- Habit tracking (no streak reset)
